# Maze-Solver-Python
Finds the shortest path between any two points in a black and white maze.
Run from the command line, pass the path to the maze image as a parameter to the maze solver.
The program will first ask for the x and y coordinate of the starting pixel and then it will ask for the coordinates of the end pixel.
The program will then ask you to chose the algorithm you wish to solve the maze. Once you make a selection, the program will find the shortest path between the two points and will print the length of the path. If there is no path, then it will print No Path Found. Depending on the size of the maze, it could take a while.
Sample mazes are provided.
